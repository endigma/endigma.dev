It's important to note that changing these values will mess with the ranging and zooming of every scope in the game, especially overlay-based scopes. Those do not scale with the viewemodel and will be inaccurate when the zoom is non-default.

I recommend the following values:

Infantry/Normal Ops: 90

Infantry/CQB (KotH, etc): 95-120 (your mildots _will_ be inaccurate)

Vehicles/Helicopters/Jets: 95-110 (higher values can make it difficult to see mines, enemies)
