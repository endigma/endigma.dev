import Arma3FoV from "$components/Arma3FoV.svelte"

<Arma3FoV client:only />

I recommend the following values:

Infantry/Ops: 70-90 (lower values will make it easier to engage at range)

Infantry/PvP (KotH, etc): 95-120

Vehicle crew: 90 (higher values can make it difficult to see mines, threats)

Helicopters and Jets: 95-110 (going too high can make it easier to takeoff/land but harder to engage enemies)
